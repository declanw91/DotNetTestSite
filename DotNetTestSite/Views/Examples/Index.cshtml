        <h3>Twitter Display</h3>
        <p>
            A small asp net core/razor project that connects to the Twitter API and returns my tweets. There is a API controller that makes a authorised request to twitter with a access token which fetches
            tweets under my account. The front end then uses razor to render the tweets on the screen as well as any images that are attached to the tweet (where applicable). It does need a few updates as it currently uses the date in the format that twitter returns it 
            but I would like to change this to be in the normal date/month/year hour:minute style format similar to the date style on my blog page.

        <h3>Vue Wine Store</h3>
        <p>
            A vuejs project to help me learn vuex, vue router and using state as well as using components.
            The project is a simple wine store that allows users to browse the wines either by colour, region or the full range.
            It also has a cart feature that currently just allows users to add to the cart and view their cart to see what items they have added.
            The cart feature will eventually be expanded.
            The styling mainly comes from bootstrap and it also uses font awesome for some icons as I do not currently have a lot of images for the site.
            This was my first real VueJs project after I learnt the basics and it is based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4deVCNJq3qc&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org">this tutorial</a>.

        <h3>Breakout Game</h3>
        <p>
            This project is my first attempt at making a game using JavaScript. I enjoy playing video games a lot and have always
            wanted to give making one a go. I came across a tutorial by FreeCodeCamp that was an intro to game dev with JavaScript and thought
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0&list=WL&index=9&t=0s">this tutorial</a> would be a good opportunity to
            finally attempt this. The game is a basic version of the brick breakout game that the tutorial covers building. This is a work in progress
            as I have been slowly expanding the game logic to include some power ups (only has one so far) as the original tutorial does not cover how to build in powerups.

        <h3>Video Game Quiz</h3>
        <p>
            This project is my first experience using the VueJS framework and is based on a tutorial that I was following
            to learn the basic concepts and get some experience in using the framework. The questions are provided by
            a third party API that returns the question, a list of possible answers and, of course, the correct answer.
            The project has two main components, the first is the header component at the top of the page showing the logo, the number of questions answered
            and the total correct answers and the second is the questionbox component which displays the question, the answers and handles the user's interaction
            with it and the submit and next buttons. The project does need a few updates and I plan to
            update it as I learn more about the framework.

        <p>
            This was an assessment at university and was my first experience with jQuery.
            The task was to create a page that allowed users to select modules
            for a welding course. The jQuery library is used to limit the selections
            based on the rules for the course.

            This is a simple version of casino blackjack that is created using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This started as
            a technical test for an interview and grew from there to be a little more graphical. It still needs some work as I
            want to improve it a little by using templating tools like MustacheJs but haven't put that part in yet.

        <p>
            This is my first real angular project and it is a one page application
            so there is no page reloading. It uses an API fom TheMovieDB on the back end
            to make a request for data after the user types in their search and submits, the angular then processes the JSON response and then
            uses it to build HTML to show on the page.

        <h3>Picture Slideshow</h3>
        <p>
            This uses a plugin for jQuery called bxslider.
            It creates a slide show of images with controls for scrolling through each of them. I learnt about this while working at a previous
            job as I had to set it up for several sites that wanted to have product carousels on some of their pages. It meant I had to
            research the plugin and the available options to set it up for each client. The slideshow is showing a few random xbox screenshots.
